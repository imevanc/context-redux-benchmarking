# Redux vs Context API Benchmark

| Feature                   | Redux                                      | Context API                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Best for**              | Large apps with complex state logic        | Simple/local state sharing                  |
| **Performance**           | Slightly slower for high-frequency updates | Faster for frequent updates                 |
| **Scalability**           | Better for large, multi-team apps          | Harder to scale beyond simple cases         |
| **Debugging & DevTools**  | Powerful Redux DevTools                    | Limited debugging tools                     |
| **Asynchronous Handling** | Middleware like Thunks/Sagas               | Requires custom hooks or external libraries |
| **Component Re-Renders**  | Can be optimized using `useSelector`       | Can cause unnecessary re-renders            |

### ✅ When to use Redux:

- If multiple components need access to global state (authentication, cart, user settings).
- If your app needs logging, undo/redo, or debugging tools.
- If you’re working in a team and need predictable, structured state management.

### ✅ When to use Context API:

- If state is localized to a section of the app (e.g., theme toggles, user preferences).
- If you want a **lightweight** state management solution with fewer dependencies.
